Final thought perhaps for the pre war report. A nice to have would be if it highlighted the time/date when the Xanax taken increases and does the same if/when the OD increases. Would give us a good indication for OD’s and who may be on Xanax CD.

Sorting enemies on the planning panel into easy/tricky/hard/group sections based on their stats compared to the owner of the api key.

Torn stats has Energy, Flight time, Drug CD & Booster CD in the Member Overview Tab. This isn't available to everyone (but you have it) and I can make it available to everyone - Access is under our control

Mobile version could have a tab that switches between both factions in war portal rather than both together like desktop.
